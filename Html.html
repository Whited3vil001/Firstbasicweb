        <br>
        To understand <b>"HTML"</b> from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:
        <br>
        <b>Hypertext</b>: Text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
        <br>
        <b>Markup</b>: A style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format
        <br>
        <b>Language</b>: A language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
        <br><br>
        HTML determines the structure of web pages. 
        <br>This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive.<br>
         So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.
        <br>
        In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.
        <br>
        <h4>HTML is the skeleton,CSS is the skin,and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.</h4>

        You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: <br>HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the 
        interior and exterior decor, <br>and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the house livable.
